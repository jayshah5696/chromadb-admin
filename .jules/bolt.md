## 2024-05-18 - [Add React.memo() to `DetailPanel` and `DataGrid`]

**Learning:** `DataGrid` and `DetailPanel` use Jotai atoms. `DetailPanel` gets `selectedRecord` and `recordDetail` which triggers re-renders. `DataGrid` gets `selectedRecord` directly to apply selected class style. Selecting a row in `DataGrid` updates `selectedRecordAtom`, which causes `DataGrid` to re-render in its entirety, checking all 20 rows and updating classes.
**Action:** The table rows in `DataGrid` can be separated into a memoized `Row` component. By doing so, when `selectedRecordAtom` updates, we avoid re-rendering all rows. We can extract the table `tr` elements into a `<TableRow>` component wrapped with `React.memo()`. The parent `DataGrid` will still re-render because it reads `selectedRecordAtom`, but if we pass primitive props or memoized callbacks to `<TableRow>`, React can skip re-rendering rows that haven't changed their selection state.

**Learning:** Even if `DataGridRow` is memoized, if the parent `DataGrid` uses `useAtom(selectedRecordAtom)`, the entire `DataGrid` will still re-render when the selection changes, causing unchanged props to be evaluated for `DataGridRow`. This makes the O(N) re-render still occur at the parent level.
**Action:** Move `useAtomValue(selectedRecordAtom)` down into `DataGridRow` itself so each row can subscribe individually to the selection state and compute its own `isSelected`. Change the parent `DataGrid` to only use `useSetAtom(selectedRecordAtom)`. This turns an O(N) parent re-render into an O(1) row re-render (only the newly selected and unselected rows re-render). For edge cases where action handlers need atom values without subscribing (like `handleDeleteRecord`), use Jotai's `useStore().get(atom)`.

## 2025-02-14 - [Isolating UI Visibility Re-renders]

**Learning:** When a parent component (like `RecordPage`) subscribes to a Jotai atom controlling the visibility of a child panel (`detailPanelOpenAtom`), toggling the panel causes the entire parent and all of its child components to re-render. In a complex page, this causes unnecessary re-renders of heavy sibling components (like `DataGrid`, `DataToolbar`, `StatusBar`).
**Action:** Create a dedicated wrapper component (e.g., `DetailPanelWrapper`) that is strictly responsible for subscribing to the visibility atom and conditionally rendering the child. The parent should mount this wrapper instead of conditionally rendering the child itself. This scopes the re-render solely to the wrapper component, keeping siblings completely untouched when the panel is toggled.
